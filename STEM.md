# Measurement Error in Atom Column Locations
## The Gist
* Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) allows us to image materials at the atomic scale.
* Each white circle in the below image represents a column of atoms in a crystal structure. 
* Learning about where the columns are in relation to where they're expected to be can tell us a lot about the properties of the material.
* There's uncertainty in the measurements of the column locations, so we account for it by building a Bayesian hiearchical model that treats locations as parameters.
* Accounting for measurement error reduces bias in our estimates.

## The Code
Here's the link to the Github repository containing the code for the MCMC's for the models we compare, the simulation study, and creating the figures and tables
